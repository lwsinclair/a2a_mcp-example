# 🧠 LLM-Powered Terminal Assistant using A2A & MCP

### [youtube link](https://youtu.be/nSjj1ZaNP2c) : Deep dive and step by step tutorial of A2A and MCP, including code walthrough

This is an LLM-powered application that allows users to execute terminal commands using simple English queries like:

> "Delete `readme.txt` on my desktop."

It leverages the **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent) and **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) to interpret and execute commands on a Linux system.
